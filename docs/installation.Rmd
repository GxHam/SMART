###Installation of SMART:
***
To use SMART, wholebrain must first be installed. The instructions to install
wholebrain can be found [here](http://www.wholebrainsoftware.org/cms/install).
Please note, if you are using a windows machine, manual installation of opencv
is no longer necessary. I highly recommend reading through some of the documentation 
for wholebrain before using this package. 

SMART is easily installed from github using the devtools package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load devtools
library(devtools) 
 
# Install SMART
devtools::install_github("mjin1812/SMART")

# Load SMART
library(SMART)

# Pull up package descriptions and list of functions
?SMART
```
